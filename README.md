# Satellite Network Topology Builder (Prototype)

This prototype uses **React 18**, **TypeScript 5** and **Vite**. It provides a simple interface with:

- Palette bar with tool buttons
- Graph canvas powered by `react-flow-renderer`
- Properties panel with a Formik form
- State management via Redux Toolkit

All data is stored in the local Redux slice `network`.
